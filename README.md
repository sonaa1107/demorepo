# demorepo
This is my first Git Repository and I am making  A simple and responsive to-do list application that allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with dynamic DOM manipulation for real-time updates. Designed with a clean UI and local storage support to save tasks between sessions.
